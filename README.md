### Welcome to the Python Personalized Movie Recs app. If you're in need of a movie recommendation, this is the tool for you!

![Python Line Break - virtual env](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84421118/123558251-48520100-d763-11eb-89b7-cba9c9d340eb.png)

## Set up virtual environment

Setup a virtual environment using the below command:
```
conda create -n movie-recs-env python=3.8
```

Then activate the virtual environment using the below command:

``` 
conda activate movie-recs-env
```

![Python Line Break - packages](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84421118/123558437-3cb30a00-d764-11eb-812c-9029917f497d.png)

## Install packages

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

![Python Line Break - tmdb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84421118/123558453-4b99bc80-d764-11eb-9ebf-a06a56480530.png)

## Create a TMBD API Key
This tool uses movie information from the **TMDB API,** so you will need to set up a TMDB API Key to use this tool. Create a TMDB account via https://www.themoviedb.org/signup and generate an API key. You will then need to store this API key later in a .env file (*instructions below*).


![Python Line Break - sendgrid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84421118/123558461-58b6ab80-d764-11eb-8ed4-e2f6c1af6007.png)

## Configuring Email Integration
Create a **SendGrid** account via https://signup.sendgrid.com/ and generate an API key. *You will then need to store this API key later in a .env file.*

Once setting up your account, select **Email API** and create your own **Dynamic Template**. Make note of the **Template ID,** as you will need to store this in your .env file later. 

After creating the Dynamic Template, select **Add Version**, then select **Blank Template**, and then select **Code Editor**.

Navigate to the **Code** page of the Dynamic Template, and paste the below code:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title></title>

Next, go to the **Test Data** page and paste the below code:

```
{
    "input_genre": "Action",
    "input_age": "Y",
    "input_block": "Y",
    "rec_title":"Avengers",

    "poster_path": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500//tnAuB8q5vv7Ax9UAEje5Xi4BXik.jpg"

}
```
Lastly, select **Settings** on the left-hand side of the screen, navigate to **Subject**, and paste "*Your Python Personalized Movie Rec*"

Make sure that you hit save at the top of the screen.

## Configuring Environment Variables
In the root directory of your local repository, create a new file called ".env", and update the contents of the ".env" file to include the below information:

> **TMBD_API_KEY** = "enter your TMDB API key here"

> **SENDGRID_API_KEY** = "enter your SendGrid API key here" <br >
> **SENDGRID_TEMPLATE_ID** = "enter your Dynamic Template ID here" <br >
> **SENDER_ADDRESS** = "enter email address you would like email rec sent to" <br >

*Note your SENDER_ADDRESS email should match the email used to setup your SendGrid account*


![Python Line Break - tesing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84421118/123558485-7edc4b80-d764-11eb-968f-1de0484a012d.png)

## Testing the Program

You can also test the program to ensure the logic is running correctly, by navigating to the root directory in the command line and entering the below command:

```
pytest
```
Running the above command will test the code's logic, and ensure that everything is functioning properly and running smoothly. 

Please also note that the repo incorporates a Continuous Integration service called **Travis CI**, which will run tests every time a pull request is opened. Travis CI can be setup using the following link, but it has already been integrated into the repo so you don't need to take any further steps here: 

> https://www.travis-ci.com/

Lastly, please note that this repo has been integrated with **Code Climate** to run checks on pull requests. While nothing is needed on the user's end, you can integrate Code Climate on your end by creating a account and linking it to your GitHub repo:

> https://codeclimate.com/oss/dashboard



![Python Line Break - usage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84421118/123558472-7257f300-d764-11eb-8270-a50705d5074d.png)


## Running the App in the Command Line

After following the above directions, you're ready to run the application and get your personalized movie reccomendation!

After you have completed the below list, you're ready to run the game:
>[ ]  Downloaded the repo to your local computer <br />
>[ ] Navigated to the repo in the command line <br />
>[ ] Setup your virtual environment <br />
>[ ] Installed the requirements.txt file <br />
>[ ] Generated a TMDB API key <br />
>[ ] Set up your SendGrid account and created a dynamic email template <br />
>[ ] Configured your environment variables<br />

To run the game, enter the following command:


```
python app/movie_reco.py
```
You will then be prompted to select a **genre** from the following list:
>Action <br >
>Adventure <br >
>Animation <br >
>Comedy <br >
>Crime <br >
>Documentary <br >
>Drama <br >
>Family <br >
>Fantasy <br >
>History <br >
>Horror <br >
>Music <br >
>Mystery <br >
>Romance <br >
>Science Fiction <br >
>TV Movie <br >
>Thriller <br >
>War <br >
>Western <br >

After selecting a genre, you will be prompted to select if you would like a **recently released film** (*film released in the past two years*).

Next, you will be prompted to select if you would like a **blockbuster** (*a popular film with a 7+ rating according to TMDB*).

The app will then generate your first recommendation! If you are not happy with your selection, you can say you would like another recommendation until you are happy with your selection.

After your recommendation is finalized, you will be asked if you would like an **email receipt** of your recommendation. If the answer is yes, you will be prompted to enter your email address, then you will receive an email receipt of your personalized recommendation.

![Python Line Break - GUI Usage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84421118/123884473-4fbb0b00-d919-11eb-8b6b-0efbdb6b848f.png)


## Running the Web App

In addition to running our *Python Personalized Movie Recs* tool in the command line, you can also run it using a **Graphical User Interphase (GUI)** in your browser. The GUI requires the same inputs as the command line tool, but uses a form rather than successive prompts.

To use our tool in a GUI, you will need to activate **flask** by entering the below commands in your command line based on your computer choice (mac vs windows):

**For Mac OS:**
```
FLASK_APP=web_app.py flask run
```

**For Windows OS:**
```
export FLASK_APP=web_app.py
flask run
```

>*NOTE: if `export` doesn't work for you, try `set` instead*

Once you run the above commands, the command line will give you a **URL** (i.e. http://127.0.0.1:5000/) that you can then copy and paste into your browser. That URL will then take you to our tool in a web app.

Once you open the web app, click the **"Movie Form"** in the top right hand corner of your screen to navigate to your user inputs section. Enter a genre, whether you want a new movie, and whether you want a blockbuster, and then hit **submit.** 

> Note that similarly to when you run the tool in the command line, a recent film is defined as a film that has been released within the past two years, and a blockbuster is defined as a film with a 7+ rating according to TMDB.

The tool will then recommend a movie for you! If you are unhappy with your selection, you can select **"Need Another?"** to generate a new movie recommendation.

## Third Party Datasets and APIs Used

Please note that movie recommendations were sourced using data from the **TMDB APi**:
